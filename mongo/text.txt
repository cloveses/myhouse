I'll never fly Delta again!!  My flight was supposed to leave MCO for ATL
 at 6:25pm on Saturday, March 26, however, due to severe weather, it was delayed until 8:12pm - no problem. At approx. 8pm we started boarding.  We just sat there at the gate.  No explanation etc. until about 9:30pm when the pilot said we were pushing away from the gate but wouldn't take off.
